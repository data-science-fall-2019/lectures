# Learning Objectives

- Learn the basics of Shiny Apps.
- [Shiny Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/shiny.pdf).
- [Shiny Tutorial](https://stat545.com/shiny00_index.html)

# Motivation

- As a data scientist, you will collaborate with researchers / managers / 
  customers who do not know R.
  
- You either want them to explore the data themselves, or you want
  to interactively explore the data together.
  
- Shiny lets you build an app that will run R using a graphical user interface.
  You write shiny apps in R.

- Folks showcase some pretty sophisticated interactive data visualizations:

- If you get really good at Shiny, you can make sophisticated websites with it:
